Preparation:
- Send the tokens you want to distribute to the TokenBuy contract for it to work.
- When you deploy the ERC721, you must set the ICO contracts as the approved for all your tokens by executing the function setApprovalForAll()
- When users want to purchase tokens, they must first approve the right amount of USDT, USDC or DAI to purchase. No need to approve ETH since it's not a token.

Information:
- Epoch 1 will allow users to auction for lands with the digit 00, 17
- Epoch 2 will allow users to auction for lands with the digit 18, 35
- Epoch 3 will allow users to auction for lands with the digit 36, 53
- Epoch 4 will allow users to auction for lands with the digit 54, 70
- Epoch 5 will allow users to auction for lands with the digit 71, 88
- Epoch 6 will allow users to auction for lands with the digit 89, 99

- Land ids must be passed as a hexadecimal string meaning it has a 0x infront of it which you can add it on the frontend, not in solidity

- Use partseInt(hex_id, 16) to convert the hex id to a number. Here are some examples to how it looks like:
-- hex: 8c2ba8d944de3ff, int: 631272015026578431
-- hex: 8c2ba8d96b761ff, int: 631272015067046399
-- hex: 8c2ba8d96b0d1ff, int: 631272015066616319

So we check the last 4 digits for the epochs
